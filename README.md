# Practice-Algorithm-Implementations

I made this repository in order to experiment with my own implementations of various algorithms and Data Structures.

Algorithms include:
Merge Sort - O(nlogn)
Karatsuba Multiplication
Brute Force Inversion Counter - Quadratic time
Merge Sort Inversion Counter - O(nlogn)
Strassens Matrix Multiplication Algorithm - subcubic
